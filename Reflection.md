What went well in this project?
-
-I gained a deeper understanding and comprehension of Springboot and 
feel confident in my ability to work with it in the future.

What did you learn through this experience (Springboot or otherwise)?
-
- I learned the usefulness of dependencies (for example: I found out that without the footer fragment,
the dropdown filters were not functional.)
- Bootstrap goes a long way in getting you started with styling your page
- OOP is my personally preferred way of programming and allows my components to
operate more efficiently and with more flexibility.

What would you like to be done differently next time?
-
- Operationally there was a bumpy start but I recognize and can appreciate the parts of this
situation that were out of anyone's control; in all reality, it only helps us prepare
for the fact that this does happen "in the real world" constantly anyway.
It's a chance to prove we can adapt to environmental changes or constrictions.

What are you still confused about after doing the project?
-
- As far as the project material goes, there's nothing I feel uncomfortable about, however,
I know outside of the classroom I need to continue learning about working with APIs. It's a subject
I'm finding that I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around even though in practice I can function well.

How well did you work with your _team_?
-
- The team effort did become more collaborative and less of a pair-programming exercise in the more strict sense.
However on a more global/classroom scale I was able to continue to advise people in debugging and understanding their code.
As always, teaching helped me learn as well.
